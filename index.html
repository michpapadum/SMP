            You don't have to make the arduous journey with your child 
            to and fro from your house to the clinic. Instead, you can
            access our wide array of exercise videos, with audio 
            instructions and a video feed for guidance. It's all just a
            tap away. Wish to carry out physiotherapy exercises? All you
            have to do is log on to our website anytime, anywhere, and 
            your child can pick up from where they left, or try their hand

        No one should have to live a life of pain. And that's what 
        Little Stretch is all about--making sure that your child lives
        a full life without any aches and pains bothering them. That 
        may seem hard to achieve, but with Little Stretch's tailored 
        website, we have just what your child needs. 

        Unlike in-person appointments, which are scheduled every now 
        and then, the web-based method of physiotherapy allows for 
        more consistent efforts.
        Once every day for 30 minutes is all it takes to see some 
        visible progress in 4-6 weeks.
